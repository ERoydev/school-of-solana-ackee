# üìö Our learning material:
We created the [Solana Handbook](https://ackee.xyz/solana/book/) to provide study material for School of Solana devs. It should serve as an entry point for new Solana developers or blockchain enthusiasts wishing to learn about Solana.

- Read the [Solana Handbook](https://ackee.xyz/solana/book/).
